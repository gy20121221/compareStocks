# compareStocks

A local-first web app for comparing stock tickers and running single-ticker strategy backtests with full static rendering.

Source code: <https://github.com/Lightwing-Ng/compareStocks>

## What it does

- compares up to five securities on a normalized cumulative return basis
- runs single-ticker backtests with built-in trading strategies (Buy and Hold, MACD, SuperTrend AI)
- supports relative time ranges (1mo → max) and exact date ranges
- can include or exclude cash dividends in total return calculations
- stores historical data, ticker profiles, logos, and symbol search results locally
- renders a lightweight responsive UI with mobile-first behavior
- works entirely in-browser after server render, no external dependencies for viewing

## Run

Use the interpreter that already has the project dependencies installed:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.13 main.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### `market_store/`

Persistent local store.

- `historical/`
  - canonical ticker parquet files
- `profiles/`
  - per-ticker profile JSON files
- `logos/`
  - cached logo images
- `search/`
  - cached symbol search results

## Ticker input rules

Ticker inputs are validated in both places:

- front end
  - blocks illegal characters and invalid formats before submit
- back end
  - rejects malformed or unsupported tickers before data fetch

Supported examples include:

- `MSFT`
- `GOOGL`
- `NVDA`
- `AMZN`
- `MU`
- `AMD`
- `META`
- `QQQ`
- `JEPQ`

## Notes

- symbol search depends partly on Yahoo Finance coverage and may vary by ticker class
- logo retrieval uses provider fallbacks and local persistence
- the app is designed for local development, not production deployment

## Timezone & Data Integrity

- **System Standard**: The application internally standardizes all market data to **New York Time (America/New_York)**, including robust handling of Daylight Saving Time (DST) via standard IANA zone identifiers.
- **Broker Data (Longbridge)**: The Longbridge OpenAPI returns 1-minute timestamps aligned with **Hong Kong Time (HKT)** numerically for US markets.
  - The fetcher (`app/broker_market_data.py`) robustly localizes these raw values as `Asia/Hong_Kong` before converting to `America/New_York`.
  - **Storage (Parquet)**: 1-minute Parquet files in `market_store/historical/` store timestamps strictly in **NYT** (naive) for cross-layer consistency.
- **Verification Tool**: A dedicated test route is available at `/test/chart/1m/<ticker>/<date>` (or `/last5`) to visually audit 1-minute bars against your broker's terminal curve for terminal-level accuracy.
